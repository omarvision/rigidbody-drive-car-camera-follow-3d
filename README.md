# rigidbody-drive-car-camera-follow-3d
I was looking around the asset store and just got the idea to quickly make a car drive around in a city. This is the really really easy simple dimple way I got a car to drive around in a city model asset from the asset store. I used physics rigidbody, city voxel model from the asset store and a car model I made in MagicaVoxel and the results are pretty good.  In the tutorial there is also a reusable camera follow 3D script. Place the script on a camera and tell it which object to follow and the camera will smoothly follow and aim at the target.
